3rd-party-cookies
=================

Quick little test to see if a user has 3rd party cookies enabled

This is mostly a note-to-self for when I need to use this in the future. I have 2 PHP files set up that try to set a cookie and then test whether the cookie is set, returning a string 'true' or 'false'. From there, just test in JS for the value and get some if else action going on.

Actual code found on http://www.ctomczyk.pl/detect-browser-cookie-third-party-using-feature-detection/91/
